harbour-xkcd
============

A simple unofficial XKCD comic viewer for SailfishOS written in C++ and QML. A big thank you to Randall Munroe for entertaining us every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

Warning: this comic occasionally contains strong language (which may be unsuitable for children), unusual humor (which may be unsuitable for adults), and advanced mathematics (which may be unsuitable for liberal-arts majors).
